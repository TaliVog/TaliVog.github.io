<h1>"Our intention is to make Uber so efficient, cars so highly utilized that for most people it is cheaper than owning a car"<i> <small>- Travis Kalanick, CEO</small></i></h1>

<p>We have an issue. The police have been trying to shut down Uber in Cape Town because Uber drivers have been taking away a massive amount of business from cab drivers while not paying taxes. <a href="http://mg.co.za/article/2015-02-12-no-fare-cry-uber-taxi-competitors">Article link</a></p>

<p>The other day, my Uber driver asked me to move from the back seat to the front passenger seat so our ride would not appear to be a "business ride" to onlookers. I willingly did so, because I LOVE Uber here in Cape Town.</p>
<p>
<i><b>Why do I love Uber in CT?</b></i><br>
<br>1. Ubers are far safer than cabs in CT. <small>My program director told me I am forbidden from riding in anything other than Uber on my own. Yes, cabs are unsafe. </small><a href="http://www.2oceansvibe.com/2015/07/13/shocking-images-show-young-blonde-girl-following-attack-outside-tiger-tiger/">Article link</a>
<br><br>2. Ubers are incredibly cheap in CT. <small>The minimum is R20, or $1.6. Compare that to the min in NYC of $8.</small>
<br><br>3. The drivers' names are hilarious.
