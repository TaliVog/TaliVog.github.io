<h1>I asked my parents if I should go bungee jumping. They said I should not.</h1>
<h3>Actually, they said I absolutely should not. But I wanted to- and nearly everyone else was- so I did! Woohoo!
<br>
Two days later I emailed the family home. Casually, I wrote:
</h3>
<p>"Check out your brave daughter/granddaughter/sister (at 216 meters, this is the highest bungee jump in the world from a bridge, and the second highest in the world overall--China's tower is slightly higher):"</p>

<h2>Their responses:</h2>

<br>
<br>
My sister Arielle:
<br><small>
"Wow amazing! You jumped so quickly, so brave!!""
</small>
<br>
<br>
My mother:
<br><small>
"Unbelievable!  I would NEVER EVER try that, and UPSIDE DOWN! Were you nauseous?  Any fears? I guess you'll have to check out China's now--then again, DON'T!! THAT WAS ENOUGH!! Thank you for not telling me in advance. I guess you didn't have to have your parent or guardian sign for you.
Just come home alive and well!
Thanks for sharing, 
love and kisses, Mommy"</small>
