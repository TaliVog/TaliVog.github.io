<h3>I fear I might develop carpool tunnel syndrome.</h3>

<p>I bought all of these beautiful postcards at the giftshop of the Botanical Gardens in Kierstenbosch. They all remain in my laptop case. As I leave Cape Town for Baltimore in two days, I figure it's best to mail my already-written postcards from Baltimore. Yes, my grandparents will see me before they receive the postcards, but it's the thought that counts, eh? My hope is that they think the mail delivery system is weak, and so even though The Responsible Tali mailed the postcards home nearly 2 months ago, the postcards did not arrive before I arrived.</p>
<p><small>Well, this way I </small>1) save Rand on stamps and 2) avoid the precarious African mailing system that might lose my beautiful postcards FOREVER.
