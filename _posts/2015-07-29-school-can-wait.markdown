<h3>New Student Orientation</h3>
<p>I no longer am a freshman, but that does not mean NSO is not for me. I like to party, and so NSO certainly is for me. This week is the only time of the year when students get to be together on campus without having any responsibilities, unless you include buying textbooks and furniture. I already got most of mine, though, so bring on the Franzia.</p>

<p><small>So I've gotten to experience this majestic week once. As a freshman, though, I had some limitations. I was told I had to attend many New Student events, including a summer reading lecture, multiple safety lectures, awkward Hall Meet And Greets, and a Hebrew placement test (which I bombed on 2 hours of sleep--!בושה). Don't get me wrong, I attended about 1/4 of these events. But knowing I was supposed to attend each one of them did taint my experience, as skipping each event for a party forced me to be slightly anxious and fearful of getting caught as I entered each frat house rather than lecture hall. Luckily the Fireball helped to ease my nerves.</small>

<p><small>I remember attending Theos' NSO pool party with the intention of leaving early in order to make it in time to my preceptorial called, "Espionage: how to catch a spy." Although the preceptorial was optional, I had signed up for it because the topic interested me so much. I had told my grandfather all about it, and he requested I ask the professor how I can catch James Bond. I knew Gramps would be disappointed if I skipped the class in order to stay at the pool party. Sorry, Gramps. I don't think I would've gotten the answer, anyway.</small></p>
<p><small>Penn provides freshmen and not upperclassmen with free meals throughout NSO. But having these meals without any time to eat them just made me feel foolish!</small></p>
<p><small>Lastly, I didn't know that many people at last year's NSO. Now I have lots of friends (or so I like to think...)! 
</small></p>
<h3>All of these factors have influenced me to believe this year's NSO will be better than last year's. And last year's was pretty fun. C u there.</h3>
