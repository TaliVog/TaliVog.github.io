<h3>Let's move on. I <i>really</i> don't want to get into those details.</h3>
<p>I know I scream at you sometimes, but as I age I realize how stupid that is of me.</p>

<p>You almost always make the loveliest impressions on everyone (the only exception that comes to mind is your screaming at Acey- that little square face!- in front of Frank), including Gloria Hack, Marlee, Brooke, Judd/Denise (I said impression, not <i>lasting</i> impression), and everyone else who meets you.</p> 

<p><center>A birthday greeting for you:</center><p>

<p>Dearest Mother,
<br>
I know I do not showcase how much I appreciate you nearly as much as I should.

<br><u>Some reasons why you are great (just a few of the many!):</u><br>
1. You have 184 windows in your house.
<br><br>
2. You reacted wonderfully to having a bat in our house but no heroic husband when my friend Jessie from Capital Camps trekked over to Baltimore to visit me.
<br>
3. You are thee most fit mother of 8 on the planet.
<br>
4. You are the most hardworking, dedicated bar/bat-mitzvah planner when it comes to your children. I'll always treasure my Voge magazine.


<p>Thank you for prioritizing all of your wonderful kids before yourself (in all regards but exercising and responding to emails). We love you and think you are the very best!</p>
